I Was born in Austin, Texas and graduated high school from the surrounding area, I left the area to attend Texas A&M in College Station, Texas. There I became a member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. and the Aggie Cadet Corps. After my freshmen year as an aerospace engineering major, I changed my major to computer science to pursue military aspirations. A change of my military career goals lead me to switch my academic pursuits towards a bachelor of science degree in economics . 


Upon graduation I got my first job as a data analyst at a WBME law firm assisting in disparity studies. A year into my roll as a data analyst, my National Guard unit was activated for a deployment to Afghanistan. Getting back from overseas, a search for a procurement specialist position in the school district lead me to become a substitute and teaching assistant. I am currently enrolled into a full stack development bootcamp through the UT Center for Professional Education to return to professional pursues in the computer science field.
