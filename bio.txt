As a born and raised Austinite, and Texas A&M alumn, I have seen Austin grow into a technology hub, which perked my interest in web development from a very young age. At Texas A&M, I joined the Cadet Corps and Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. to build my community with the intention to get into technology within the military. I graduated with a BS in Economics, which fueled my practical results oriented side, and economic market interest. After graduation I was working as a data analyst when I got the option to deploy in Afghanistan. 

Currently, I am working full time as a substitute teacher and tutor as well as enrolled in the UT Full Stack Bootcamp where I am learning a MERN based application. I have a thirst for programming, and am excited to pursue this career which I hope to later use with my market knowledge.

There I became a member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. and the Aggie Cadet Corps. After my freshmen year as an aerospace engineering major, I changed my major to computer science to pursue military aspirations. A change of my military career goals lead me to switch my academic pursuits towards a bachelor of science degree in economics . 


Upon graduation I got my first job as a data analyst at a WBME law firm assisting in disparity studies. A year into my roll as a data analyst, my National Guard unit was activated for a deployment to Afghanistan. Getting back from overseas, a search for a procurement specialist position in the school district lead me to become a substitute and teaching assistant. I am currently enrolled into a full stack development bootcamp through the UT Center for Professional Education to return to professional pursues in the computer science field.
